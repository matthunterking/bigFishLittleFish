### Project Overview and Motivation
I put this project together in a couple of days while working as a Teaching Assistant at General Assembly in London. I wanted to see what I could create within a limited timeframe and between other pieces of work.

Big Fish Little Fish is a simple arcade style game where eating smaller fish allows the players size to increase. Eating a fish which is larger than you ends the game.   

### Timeframe

### Approach
I began by creating a function which added the players character to the screen and assigned event listeners to the arrow keys for movement. After this I created the function which creates the enemy fish and moved onto collision detection. Finally I adding in the functionality to spawn multiple enemy fish and animate them before adding some basic styling.

### Challenges

A challenge with this project was to create a function which detected collision and removed the fish which triggered the function. It was also difficult to dip in and out of the project across the 2 days.

### Wins

Although there is much more I could add to this project I was really pleased with how much I managed to produce in such a short amount of time. I enjoyed adding in randomised enemy fish sizes (based on the players current size) and start positions.

### Future features

If I had more time I would work on the game over feature and add a reset button. I would also like to display the players score.
